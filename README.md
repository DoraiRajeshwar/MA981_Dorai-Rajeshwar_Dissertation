FORECATING STOCK PRICE BY TIME SERIES ANALYSIS

There is an increasing trend among individuals to allocate their funds into investment endeavours, with the aim of constructing a diversified portfolio that facilitates early retirement or the achievement of longstanding aspirations. This tendency could potentially be attributed to an increased awareness among the general population on the significance of exercising cautious financial planning. Nevertheless, a considerable proportion of these individuals exhibit a deficiency in prior trading experience, as well as a lack of familiarity with the terminology and analytical techniques employed in the financial market. Consequently, they are resorting to algorithmic trading as a means of gaining initial exposure and experience in this domain. As a computer science student specialising in data, I find it intriguing to contemplate the rapid pace at which technology has evolved in recent years. I am deeply fascinated by the potential for achieving a high degree of accuracy in capturing stock price movements, as well as the observed tendency of individuals to improve their trading effectiveness. These factors have motivated my pursuit of a career specialising in the predicting of future stock prices. In the future, I aspire to leverage my acquired knowledge to provide valuable assistance to individuals in enhancing their decision-making process in the realm of trading. To predict the performance of the stock market, we have categorised the techniques into two advanced methodologies: deep learning (specifically BLSTM), known for its significant computational intricacy and encompassing a majority of the potential approaches, and time series analysis (including the ARIMA model and SARIMAX model). The ARIMA model and the SARIMAX model are utilised for the purpose of forecasting stock trading volumes within a given time frame. The utilisation of Amazon stock data available on the Yahoo Finance website can be employed to effectively accomplish the objective of predicting stock market prices. In this study, we employ the ARIMA, SARIMAX, and bidirectional LSTM models to construct a versatile model capable of providing comprehensive visibility into historical stock trading prices over any given time frame.
